Kernel SVM or Kernel Support Vector Machine Classification is based on Non Linear Classification. It is first given in the 2D plane, then it is converted to the 3D plane, and then converted back to the 2D plane. It can have one or multiple Landmarks, therefore, in the formula for Kernel SVM, l^i is used, where l is the Landmark. It is found at the middle of the graph as shown in the screenshots.
